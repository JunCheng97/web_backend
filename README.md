# web_backend

## Introduce
This project is a get, post and ajax method pratice. These should be easiest way to implement these method.

In project contain cilent and server code (nodejs), you can click on the [link](http://luffy.ee.ncku.edu.tw/~yangyang95/http/) and see the result

## Structure
* **get** - `get.njs`
* **post** - `post.njs`
* **ajax** - `search.js`, `ajax.njs`

Be careful, `.njs` file extension is same `.js` extension. Using this extension is becuase of school server setting.

## Notice
Note that I learn these method just at this point, so something may be incorrect or have better way to implement.
